						The men of Dunne started the semester off strong with a Famous Couples SYR. Kim & Kanye, Donald and Melania, as well as Brad and Angelina all made the trip to the Rockne Memorial’s gym. Dunne’s second SYR was an Aspen-like apres-ski experience that featured plenty of the best fashion trends of the 80s. 
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						The following day, the men of Dunne gathered in the lobby to board buses, on their way to Dunne’s first annual ski trip. At Swiss Valley Ski Area in Michigan, the men of Dunne skied and boarded their way to a good time. Everyone came back in one piece, although Fr. Kevin and other experienced skiers were left aghast at some of the bumps and bruises some Sentinels sustained.

						Even in its first year, Dunne Hall has big plans for the future. In the works is a Spartan-Race style obstacle course race at White Field, with many other University and community partners participating. Additionally, Dunne plans to throw it back to NBC’s days at Dunder-Mifflin paper company by hosting the Dunndies, and end-of-year awards show that will look back on the year we shared in Dunne, while giving out some awards and verbal jabs alike!

						The Sentinels also engage in a number of recurring events, including Wednesday Hall Gov and Sunday Mass. A group of Sentinels has also begun to engage in a weekly campus beautification project, while another group has been working with the Notre Dame Center for Arts and Culture to mentor youth in the community. Sentinels have also hosted board game events, Masses, Eucharistic Adoration, and the occasional Guitar Hero or Rockband foray.

						<b>Feast:</b> An event put on by our founder Jimmy Dunne and his fellow roommates. Starts with mass, then a mixer and is lastly followed by a multi-course catered meal. It is a suit and tie affair with one’s section and has words of inspiration from the founders of Dunne on a successful college career. 
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						<b>Aspen in the 80s:</b> Following the week of the feast, Dunne first takes its community to the dance floor then to slopes. Following a dance the night before, the community goes up to Swiss Valley Michigan where they ski until dark. 
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						<b>Dunne Funne Runne:</b> An event that has not even happened yet! This Funne Runne also called the Andre 3000 is a 3k, 3 person relay (not much running) that is also focused on the celebration before and after. All proceeds benefit Education Bridge, a company founded by a Dunne Hall resident that goes to providing education in South Sudan. 
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						<b>Third Floor Core:</b> A Dunne Tradition that works every part of a person’s character. It starts with an ab workout to train the physical side. Then the participants attend 10pm mass for their spiritual core. Lastly, they eat a whole apple core for a symbolic mastering of the person (not really, this is just to show dominance over fruit). Happens on semi-regular basis!
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						<b>Pizza with Fr. Kevin:</b> After every Tuesday night mass, residents go up to the fourth floor to have pizza in Fr. Kevin’s apartment where they talk about a whole host of issues (mainly those that have absolutely nothing to do with religion yet Fr. Kevin brings it back around to that). 
					</p>
					<p class="indented">
						<b>The Dunnedies:</b> A play on the Dunder Mifflin award show, this event takes place at Legend’s Night Club where all the men of Dunne receive awards (some serious, some not) that highlight their achievements throughout the year. Food and good roasts are provided.
