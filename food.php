						During Dunne’s first semester, roommates junior Ryan Green and sophomore Cam Kormylo inaugurated what is sure to be a storied tradition of food sales in Dunne. They cooked up what all agreed were the best tacos between here and Chicago.

						In the spring, RAs Andrew and Michael entered the fray, beginning what is now known as “My Lil’ Griddle”. After an initial grease fire stalled projects, the duo rose from the ashes (literally) to serve the finest of breakfast foods on selected evenings. Although many Sentinels can be seen prompting exiting the dorm when these two are manning the griddle (in order to prevent fire alarms from encroaching on their studies) many more stay for the inexpensive eats.

						A number of new potential entrepreneurs will be vied to replace the RAs for the Fall 2017 semester. What remained were two different food sales both with interesting product. The first, Four Coasts Waffle and Floats (Open Friday and Saturday nights), sells (surprisingly) waffles and floats! The second, East Dining Hall (Open Thursday and Sunday nights), is known for a variety of other treats, chief among them is the delicious pizzadilla. Yes a pizza that instead of a crust has a quesadilla.
