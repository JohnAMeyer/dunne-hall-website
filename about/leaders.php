										Welcome to Dunne Hall! I am a 2nd year Law Student, and I look forward to being a member of Dunne as an Assistant Rector for the next two years. I am a proud Texan (although, who isn't?) who grew up in the Dallas area, graduated from Texas A&M with an economics degrees, and worked in Houston before making the move up to South Bend. I've worked with microfinance organizations in South America, as an investment banking analyst and as a middle school teacher for two years. I also had the privilege of helping start and run Young Catholic Professionals of Houston (now in 17 cities across the country and a good community to get involved with after your time at ND). Looking forward to getting to know the men of Dunne by playing a round on the golf course, while watching Cowboy games, through lively political and morality discussions, over a meal at the dining hall, or on a walk to the grotto.
