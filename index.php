								Dunne is in just its second year which means that we are still forming who we are and what we want we want to be. Though we do not have many traditions, we do have some basic qualities that identify who we are. Dunne is proud of its community and its willingness to adapt to new events, ideas, qualities, or traditions. We hope whoever comes through Dunne’s doors will be just as willing to contribute to the community and establish Dunne Hall as one of the premier dorms on campus.

								Dorm Mascot and Colors: Dunne has adopted a similar color palette as the Seattle Seahawks with a Dark Blue, Wolf Gray, and Action Green. This is paired with our dorm mascot the Sentinels, a position in castles and other houses meant to protect and guard the house. Dunne has taken up this mascot meaning to represent our geographic position at the edge of campus and our goal as a dorm to protect one’s fellow brother and resident.

								Dorm Motto: Potentia Videre, Fortitudo Agire (The competence to see and the courage to act)
