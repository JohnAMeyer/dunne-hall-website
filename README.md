# Dunne Hall Website
This website is being built as the inaugural website of Dunne Hall, a male dorm at the University of Notre Dame.
## Getting Started
This website uses HTML, PHP, JS, and CSS. All that is required to run on a localhost is a webserver like WAMP.
## Contributions
As this is essentially a solo project, I am not expecting for anyone else to contribute.
I am hosting on Github to show off my programming skills to potential employers and for the inevitable fact someone else will take over eventually.
